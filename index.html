  <h1>Problems in focus for solar panels scheme</h1>
  <p>Ordinary folk will find it almost impossible to install their own solar panels under existing laws in Hong Kong.

This is the view of green groups in the wake of Tuesday's government announcement of the feed-in tariff scheme under which each unit of electricity generated by renewable sources, including a solar photovoltaic system and a wind system, could be sold to the two major power companies in the SAR for either HK$3 or HK$5.

Speaking on a radio program yesterday, the liaison officer of 350HK, Prentice Koo Wai-muk, called the rate attractive. But he was concerned at the complexity of the scheme.

"It might be the highest rate in the world, but at the same time it reflects the difficulty of using a solar photovoltaic system in Hong Kong," Koo said.

He said families would need to submit professional drawings to the Buildings Department to install the panels.

"It's almost impossible for individuals to set up their own solar panels," he said.

Koo suggested the government simplify the rules and provide more information about different service providers to attract more citizens.

He also suggested that tall buildings in urban areas install the panels via the owners' corporations of the buildings so that residents would not need to handle it themselves.

Koo reminded people to join now as the government might adjust the rate soon. Macau reduced the rate by 30 percent over three years.

William Yu Yuen-ping, a member of the Energy Advisory Board, said the government may encourage theme parks to join the plan, and may subsidize schools to install the panels.

He said theme parks are usually large open spaces, which are suitable for the renewable energy system.

William Leung Chin-pang, director of HKSolar.info, estimated that the number of village houses with solar panels installed will rise from 20 to more than 100 after the Feed-in Tariff takes effect. The installation cost for a regular village house rooftop would be about HK$80,000 to HK$100,000.</p>
